# Classification_model
# Getting Started

At first, you need to clone this repo and open it in IDE.

```
git clone https://github.com/stasbadey/classification_model.git
```

### How to run application?

You have two ways to use this model. First, you can simply use my pretrained model located at "model/classifier.h5". 
If you want to modify the results provided by the model, you need to train it yourself. 
To do this, you need to modify the file test.py by changing the name of your classification model and adjusting the parameters as needed, such as the number of layers and the number of epochs, etc.
